# Fourierizer

![header image](images/MainImage.png)

A single-page application written in TypeScript to demonstrate the fact that complex functions can be approximated by the sum of sines and cosines of integer frequencies.

It lets you draw any closed shape and then animates the corresponding [complex fourier series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_Fourier_transform) as the vector sum of rotating circles.
